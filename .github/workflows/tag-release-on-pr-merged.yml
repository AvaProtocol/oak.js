        # Pull Request body must contain a line equal to: Tags {NewTag} (example: Tags 1.25.3). The tag format can be validated using a regex (see Action inputs below). The Tags word can be singular (Tag), and also be lowercase. The merge commit on the base branch will be tagged with the tag specified on the body.
        # This action supports defining just a single tag per PR (the first detected tag on the PR body will be used).
        # Tags cannot be repeated (if a tag already exists, the action will fail).
